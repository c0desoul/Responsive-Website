        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The majority of Indian children attend government run schools.
             Education is free socially and economically for children until the age of 14. 
             An Education Ministry data from 2017 showed that 65.2% (113 million,) of all school 
             students in 20 states attend government schools (c. 2017).[78] These include schools runs by
             the state and local government as well as the central government. Example of large center 
             government run school systems are Kendriya Vidyalaya in urban areas, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya 
             for the gifted students, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya for girls belonging to 
             vulnerable SC/ST/OBC classes, and Indian Army Public Schools run by the Indian Army for the
             children of military personnel.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is a Concurrent List subject, 
            that is both the Indian central government, and the state governments have responsibility
             for enacting and implementing education policy.[42] The central board and most of the state 
             boards uniformly follow the "10+2" pattern of education.[43]: 3  In this pattern, study of 10 years 
             is done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges (Maharashtra) or Higher Secondary 
             Schools(most other states),[43]: 44  and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree.[44] The first
             10 years is further subdivided into 8 years of elementary education (5 years Primary School 
             and 3 years Middle School), 2 years of Secondary education followed by 2 years of Higher Secondary
             Schools or Junior colleges.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run
            public education system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: central,
            state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children
            to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
            fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number
            of public schools to private schools in India is 10:3.
